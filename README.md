## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

DuckLab provides local SQL notebook experience for adhoc data analysis. It uses DuckDB to process your data within browser and VS Code. No data leaves your machine.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

### Prerequisites

It is recommended to use `pnpm`,

```

```

Or if you are using `npm`

# start the dev server
npm run dev
```
